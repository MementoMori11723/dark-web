  <p>
    This hidden service was created to provide a space where people can access
    information and services without fear of surveillance, censorship, or
    profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>Why It Exists</h2>
  <p>
    The internet is no longer a free space. Mass surveillance, censorship laws,
    and data exploitation have made privacy a privilege rather than a right.
    This project aims to reclaim some of that freedom by operating within the
    Tor network.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Freedom of Access</strong>: Anyone with Tor can visit — there is
      no geoblocking or censorship here.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Minimalism</strong>: We collect as little data as possible —
      ideally none.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security by Design</strong>: No trackers. No third-party scripts.
      No leaks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decentralization Friendly</strong>: We support projects like IPFS,
      Tails, and Monero.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote>
    "In a world where surveillance is the norm, privacy becomes resistance."

  <h2>We Recommend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <strong>Tails OS</strong> if your life depends on anonymity.</li>
    <li>
      Enable <strong>JavaScript blocking</strong> if you’re unsure of the site’s
      safety.
    </li>
    <li>Verify any .onion addresses through trusted channels.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Histroy of the dark web</h2>
    <p>
      The Dark Web traces back to the 1990s, when researchers at the U.S. Naval
      Research Laboratory began developing ways to ensure anonymous
      communication over the internet. This led to the creation of Tor (The
      Onion Router), a network that anonymizes traffic using layered encryption.
      Initially designed for military and government use, Tor was later released
      as open-source software in 2002, allowing anyone to access the internet
      anonymously. Over time, this enabled the creation of hidden websites
      accessible only through the Tor network — these sites use “.onion” domains
      and became the foundation of what we now call the Dark Web. The term
      gained wider recognition around 2011 with the rise of marketplaces like
      Silk Road, where users could buy illegal goods using Bitcoin. Although
      authorities shut down Silk Road in 2013, many similar platforms emerged in
      its place. Today, the Dark Web is a controversial space — known both for
      enabling privacy and freedom of speech in oppressive regimes, and for
      facilitating illegal activities such as drug trafficking, data breaches,
      and cybercrime.

    <h2>Safties of the dark web</h2>
    <p>
      Accessing the Dark Web requires strict safety measures to protect your
      privacy and security. Since this hidden part of the internet is often
      unregulated and filled with malicious actors, it's essential to use tools
      like the Tor Browser, which hides your IP address and encrypts your
      traffic. To stay safe, users should never reveal personal information,
      avoid downloading unknown files, and steer clear of illegal content, which
      can carry serious legal consequences. Using a Virtual Private Network
      (VPN) in combination with Tor can provide an extra layer of anonymity.
      It's also recommended to browse using a virtual machine or a live
      operating system like Tails to isolate your activity from your main
      system. Trusting random sites or marketplaces is risky, as many are scams
      or contain malware. Ultimately, the safest way to explore the Dark Web is
      with caution, anonymity, and clear boundaries, ensuring that you don’t
      unintentionally expose yourself to threats or criminal liability.

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Why would you ask that? This is the Dark Web, not a school project. We
      believe in privacy, anonymity, and keeping our noses (and names) out of
      your business — and we expect the same courtesy. Just think of us as a
      friendly shadow: always here, never seen.
